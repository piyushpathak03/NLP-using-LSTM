# Fake-New-LSTM

## LSTM
Long short-term memory is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points, but also entire sequences of data.

## Bidirectional LSTMs
Bidirectional LSTMs are an extension of traditional LSTMs that can improve model performance on sequence classification problems. In problems where all timesteps of the input sequence are available, Bidirectional LSTMs train two instead of one LSTMs on the input sequence.

## Passive-Aggressive algorithms
Passive-Aggressive algorithms are generally used for large-scale learning. It is one of the few â€˜online-learning algorithmsâ€˜. In online machine learning algorithms, the input data comes in sequential order and the machine learning model is updated step-by-step, as opposed to batch learning, where the entire training dataset is used at once. This is very useful in situations where there is a huge amount of data and it is computationally infeasible to train the entire dataset because of the sheer size of the data. We can simply say that an online-learning algorithm will get a training example, update the classifier, and then throw away the example.

A very good example of this would be to detect fake news on a social media website like Twitter, where new data is being added every second. To dynamically read data from Twitter continuously, the data would be huge, and using an online-learning algorithm would be ideal.

Passive-Aggressive algorithms are somewhat similar to a Perceptron model, in the sense that they do not require a learning rate. However, they do include a regularization parameter.
